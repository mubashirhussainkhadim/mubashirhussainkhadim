# Mubashir Hussain - Full Stack Developer

## About Me

Hi, I am **Mubashir Hussain**, an experienced Full Stack Web Developer with a strong focus on **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, **Livewire**, **PHP**, and other modern web technologies. I have extensive experience in building robust, scalable web applications using **Laravel** for both backend and frontend development. I specialize in creating interactive user interfaces with **Vue.js** and **Livewire** to enhance user experience and maintain dynamic data binding between the server-side and client-side.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel, PHP, MySQL, RESTful APIs
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Vue Router, Vuex, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **UI Frameworks**: Tailwind CSS
- **Livewire**: Building interactive components directly in Laravel using Livewire for real-time data updates
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CMS**: WordPress

## Laravel Development

I use **Laravel** as my primary framework for building web applications. It offers powerful tools and features for routing, database management, user authentication, caching, task scheduling, and more. I also leverage **Livewire** to build dynamic, responsive user interfaces within Laravel, enabling a rich SPA-like experience without the need for heavy JavaScript frameworks like Vue or React.

## Vue.js & Livewire

- **Vue.js**: I utilize Vue.js for developing reusable components, managing state, and handling complex user interactions on the client side. It allows for reactive data binding, component-based architecture, and seamless integration with Laravel.
- **Livewire**: I use Livewire to build Laravel-powered components that can directly communicate with the server-side to render views and manage data updates. It simplifies the process of creating reactive data updates and interactive forms in Laravel applications.
